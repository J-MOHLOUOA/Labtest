         <p>She looked beautiful, all stylish ands glowing. She always looked good. I guess money does make<br> you happy and beautiful. I envied her, the life of spending a lot of cash without worries;<br> not checking price tags and buying stuff that you don’t really need. Well, some people <br>are much luckier than us. She asked me to go with them to Durban. I had never been to<br> the beach before so you could measure my excitement in kilograms. As I went out <br>I saw a huge car, I didn’t even know its name. Last time she came in a Polo <br>but now she was in a new big one. This lady is loaded big time, I thought to myself.We got in a car and <br>made our way to Durban. Excitement was running through my veins, I couldn’t wait to go to the beach.</p>
